            Rotterdam, the second-largest city in the Netherlands, stands as a
            testament to resilience, innovation, and architectural boldness.
            Unlike many other Dutch cities that maintain their historical charm,
            Rotterdam embraces modernity with open arms, largely due to its
            reconstruction following World War II.
          </p>

          <h2>A City Reborn Through Architecture</h2>
          <p>
            After the devastating Rotterdam Blitz of 1940, which destroyed much
            of the city center, Rotterdam took a different path than simply
            rebuilding what was lost. Instead, it became an architect's
            playground, resulting in a skyline punctuated by cutting-edge
            buildings like the iconic Cube Houses, the sweeping Erasmus Bridge,
            and the pencil-shaped Euromast observation tower.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Markthal, a horseshoe-shaped residential and office building
            with a food market underneath an art-covered archway, represents the
            innovative spirit of Rotterdam. Its striking design combines
            functionality with artistic expression, offering visitors both
            culinary delights and architectural wonder.
          </p>

          <h2>Europe's Largest Port</h2>
          <p>
            For centuries, Rotterdam's identity has been tied to its port—the
            largest in Europe. The harbor has continuously evolved, from
            handling traditional cargo to becoming a high-tech logistics hub.
            The Maasvlakte 2 extension represents the port's forward-thinking
            approach, with automated container terminals setting new standards
            in efficiency and sustainability.
          </p>

          <h2>Cultural Hotspots</h2>
          <p>
            Beyond its architectural marvels, Rotterdam boasts a vibrant
            cultural scene. The Kunsthal Rotterdam hosts an ever-changing array
            of exhibitions, while the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen houses a
            magnificent collection of fine art. The city's multicultural
            population contributes to its dynamic food scene, with markets and
            restaurants offering flavors from around the world.
